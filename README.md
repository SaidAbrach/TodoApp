# Todo App

## Overview

Welcome to my Todo App! This project is a simple and intuitive web application that helps you manage your daily tasks efficiently. The main goal was to create an interactive, user-friendly tool that allows you to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app ensures that your tasks are saved locally so they persist even after you close your browser.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Quickly add new items to your todo list.
- **Edit tasks**: Modify existing tasks as needed.
- **Mark tasks**: Check off completed tasks to stay organized.
- **Delete tasks**: Remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
- **Persistent storage**: Uses `localStorage` to keep your tasks safe even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the app.
- **CSS**: Adds styling and layout to enhance user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Handles interactivity and task management logic.

## Motivation

I created this app to deepen my understanding of front-end development and to showcase how web technologies can be used to build practical tools. It serves as a testament to my commitment to improving my coding skills and building user-centric applications.
